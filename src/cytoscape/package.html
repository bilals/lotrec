Core Cytoscape Classes.
</P>
Cytoscape is a software pacakge designed to enable the vizualization
and analysis of networks.&nbsp; While commonly used for biological
networks, it is designed to be able to accomodate any field which
requires a junction between graph theory and associated data.<br>
<br>
The Cytoscape API is designed to be easy to use, and intuitive.&nbsp;
Which means that most method names are fairly boring, and follow Java
standards, so there are a lot of get/set methods.&nbsp; More
information on using the classes can be found at
http://www.cytoscape.org/alpha.html .&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In general, the most commonly used classes will be found in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">cytoscape</span> package.&nbsp; So:<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
import cytoscape.*;<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>will be sufficent
for many of your classes.&nbsp; The class <span
 style="font-style: italic;">cytoscape.Cytoscape</span> is where <span
 style="font-style: italic;">CyNodes&nbsp; </span>and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">CyEdges</span> are created.&nbsp; This is
done via the <span style="font-style: italic;">getCyNode&nbsp; </span>and
<span style="font-style: italic;">getCyEdge</span> methods.&nbsp; Note
that Cytoscape does its best to not create duplicate nodes and
edges.&nbsp; All of the nodes and edges are then accessable from <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Cytoscape.&nbsp; </span>To actually do
things like run algorithms a <span style="font-style: italic;">CyNetwork
</span>is required.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">createNetwork&nbsp;
</span>series of methods will get you started in that directions.<br>
<br>
Generally, working with <span style="font-style: italic;">CyNetworks</span>
is the preffered method of interacting with Cytoscape.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">CyNetwork</span> contains many methods for
easily writing Graph algoroithms, and for the smooth integration of
data.&nbsp; More information can be found in the Developer
documentation.<br>
