To run LoTREC, download "LoTREC-distribution.zip", extract it and execute the "run.bat" file.
In case the execution does not succeed, please refer to the "README.txt" that can be found besides the "run.bat" file.

Alternatively, fork then checkout LoTREC's code base from a NetBeans project, then build and run it.
You may also download the source code directly from GitHub.

Please feel free to contact us here on GitHub, to fork the project, contribute to it and send us pull requests to integrate your contributions. [An official roadmap shall be defined soon, so that we do not make redundant development efforts]
